Heart Play account and data deletion guide:

There are 2 options to delete your account on Heart Play.
The first one is to delete your account and all associated data
directly from the appÂ´s settings. Once you see the deletion confirmation,
your account, authentication and all in-game data are permanently
deleted.

The second option, should the app not be available for some reason,
is to email "heartplayservice@gmail.com". In that case your account and
in-game data will be deleted by a human operator. You might need to
provide basic account info on that request (such as email or anything
the operator needs in order to identify your account).



Data that is erased permanently once the account deletion is requested and performed
either from the app or through a human operator:

1. Your authentication is erased from our database. Meaning you will no longer
be recognised as a user of the app and you will not be able to login unless you
sign up again and create a new account.

2. All your chat messages and AI responses, as well as the custom characters,
in game currency, billing chronology, and all other in-game data is permanently
erased.




Data we keep for security (interference detection or unlawful behaviour from abusers):

1. We keep a hashed device ID of the phone/system you used in order to run the app.
2. We keep your email adress in a list of past users.
3. We keep your provider ID (Google or Apple, depending what you signed in with).
4. We erase that data too after a period of 24 months. The period can be much longer
if abuse or tampering is detected or suspected from a specific user.
