Heart Play allows users to permanently delete their in-game messages and personal profile data while keeping their account active.
This feature offers greater control over personal information without requiring full account deletion.

1. Delete directly from the app

You can delete your data directly from the in-app settings:
Settings â†’ Delete All Data (Partial)
Once confirmed, all your in-game chat messages, AI interactions, and profile information are permanently erased. This cannot be undone.
Your authentication credentials, purchases, and app access remain intact.

2. Request deletion by email

If the app is unavailable, you can request data deletion by contacting:
ðŸ“© heartplayservice@gmail.com

Please include your account email and any details needed to identify your account.
A support operator will process your request and confirm the deletion.




The following information is permanently erased once data deletion is confirmed:

All chat messages and AI-generated responses.

Your in-game user profile.



Data retained:

The following data remains stored after partial data deletion:

Your authentication credentials (so you can continue accessing the app).

Your custom characters, in-game currency, and purchase history.

Your device ID and provider ID (Google or Apple), used for account access and security.




Data retained for security reasons:

Minimal data (hashed device ID, account email, and provider ID) may be stored for up to 24 months to prevent fraud, detect abuse, or comply with legal obligations.
